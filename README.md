**Mechz** is the first open-world play-to-earn Mech Adventure game. 
It uses the Tezos blockchain and wallet to let players keep their loot and trade with others. As the game expands, the world will grow along with the adventure. So get a **Experimemtal Fuel Cell** and mount up to **Mechz!** 

### NFT Gaming on Tezos!
- NFT gaming is the fastest growing segment in Web3
- Gaming offers greater retention than Defi & Art Markets
- Mechz integrates other NFT Markets like [Objkt.com](https://objkt.com/) to boost adoption.
- Powered by Tezos - Clean NFTs!

### Roadmap
1. **Experimental Fuel Cell**
The first major bit of functionality will be to allow certain VIPs, influencers and whales to get early access to the game world. So our first NFT is the Experimental Fuel Cell. When purchased, the owner will be able to board a mech and play Mechz.

2. **Unlock Classes**
Our next NFTs will be a series of characters that will allow you to change your hero's appearance and even add special skills. The character NFTs will be dropped over a period of time as they are revealed. 

3. **Unlock Worlds** 
The open-world nature of Mechz contributes to secret and exclusive areas that are unlocked with Game World NFTs. These can be won by playing Mechz or purchased. 

4. **Unlock Missions**
Mechz will have special missions that can only be accessed by holding special mission NFTs. These will primarily be collaborations with other artists on Tezos. 

5. **Buy Land**
As the game world expands, we'll offer players the opportunity to own a part of Mechz. Players can purchase open land as well as existing shops and locations. The land will offer customization of the game world through blockchain ownership.

6. **Factions**
The next thing we'll bring players of Mechz is the ability to join factions. Each faction will have a special reward and unique missions. Factions will encourage teamwork and collaboration.

If you own an Experimental Fuel Cell, you have unlimited access to the Mechz world as it's being built.

One ticket is all you need. It doesn't get burned or destroyed when you access the game-world.

You'll be able to see the world evolve and grow as you have access to the untested wilderness and rough towns that will become the final game-world.
